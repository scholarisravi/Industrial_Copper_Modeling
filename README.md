# Industrial Copper Modeling

## Overview
This project aims to develop machine learning models for predicting various aspects related to industrial copper transactions. The models are designed to assist stakeholders in making informed decisions regarding copper purchases, sales, and logistics.

## Features
- **Regression Model:** Predicts the selling price of copper based on various input parameters such as quantity, country, item type, thickness, etc.
- **Classification Model:** Predicts the status of a transaction (e.g., Won or Lost) based on customer details, product information, and other relevant factors.

## Getting Started
To use the models, follow these steps:
1. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
2. Run the Streamlit app by executing `streamlit run app.py` in your terminal.
3. Use the user interface to input the required parameters and get predictions from the models.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage
1. Launch the Streamlit app.
2. Input the required parameters such as item date, quantity, country, etc., into the respective fields.
3. Click the "Submit" button to get predictions from the models.
4. View the predicted selling price or transaction status displayed on the app interface.
